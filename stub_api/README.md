API Suggestions
===============

Core API
-----------
 * list of available books, with core metadata:
        ```/books.json```
 * book info, with metadata and a list of pages with place refs and a list of places appearing here, core data only:
        ```/book/<book_id>/full.json```
        (I've been thinking about renaming this to ```/book/<book_id>.json```, which is probably more consistent - I originally thought that would be a stripped-down book info API, but I don't see the point now)
 * page info, including text - id either number or other id scheme (note the syntax I'm suggesting for marking place references in the HTML text):
        ```/book/<book_id>/page/<page_id>.json```
 * detailed place info, including geometry, description, metadata, etc (there might be additional metadata we might add):
        ```/place/<place_id>.json```
